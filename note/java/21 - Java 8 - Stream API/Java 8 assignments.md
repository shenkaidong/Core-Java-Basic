1)Given a list of Objects, write a method that returns a list of all strings that start with the letter 'a' (lower case) and have exactly 3 letters. TIP: Use Java 8 Lambdas and Streams API's.  

```java
public List<String> search(List<Peron> list) {//new Person(name, age, sex)
//write the stream logic hear
}
```

2)Write a method that returns a comma separated string based on a given list of integers. Each element should be preceded by the letter 'e' if the number is even, preceded by the letter 'o' if the number is odd. For example, if the input list is (3,44), the output should be 'o3,e44'.  

```java
public String getString(List<Integer> list) {
//Write the stream logic hear
}
```	

3)Write a method that returns the average of a list of integers.  

```java
public Double average(List<Integer> list) {
//write the stream logic hear
}
```

4)Write a method that converts all strings in a list to their upper case.  

```java
public List<String> upperCase(List<String> list) {
//write the stream logic hear
}
```
